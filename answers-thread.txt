Why are there missing keys with 2 threads, but not with 1 thread?
    answer: 2 threads may cause data race when one thread is calling insert() without finishing and interrupted. the other one is also calling.
            the insert:  e->next = n will cause two new entry connect to one entry and then *p = e will cause one entry will be overfloped even though their
            key is different (same key cause overflope is no problem).
